Although it was difficult to work here, the part time staff were great and really welcomed you to the City. \r Do your research before moving to Yellowknife, the City fails to tell you about the night life and the potential dangers. The week after I left there was a ra pe behind the pool, something I got to know about while living there....I spiralled emotionally out of control and no one gave me any support, rather giving me a cold shoulder. \r After having left, and working across Canada for many years, I met and worked with a former full time staff who also had the same experiences and found that the director/supervisor was continuing to play favourites and pulling strings that shouldn't be pulled. \r It's a shame, because Yellowknife is beautiful City with beautiful people.", "pros": "Salary, location, positive life experiences in the north", "cons": "Management, team favourites", "date_created": "April 2, 2017"},

I was responsible for the senior administration and setting up of a newly formed office. We reported to a volunteer Board of Directors, who led us to hosting the 2008 Arctic Winter Games, in Yellowknife. The best part of this position, was creating new templates, procedures,meeting new people, building community relations and seeing the Games grow to over 2400 volunteers. I received a promotion in September 2006, as the Volunteer Coordinator. I worked  with all of our divisions (IT, Security, Accreditation, Special Guests, Volunteer & Protocol, Accommodations, Food Services, Sport Technical, Marketing, Fundraising) in ensuring their volunteer requirements were met.
