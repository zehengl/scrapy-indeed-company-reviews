I learnt about heavy machinery and how to operate it, including the acquisition of my air-brakes endorsement.\r Every day began at 07:30, with a meeting at around 07:40. We would discuss what was to be done during that day, and the tasks to be assigned for that day. Following this, we would load our trucks up with the necessary equipment, being sure to check all of it before leaving. Then we would perform a 'circle-check' where we inspect the vehicle for anything that might not be working properly and needs repairs. This was recorded on a log book which was filled out when you start using the vehicle, and once again when you stopped. \r The assigned tasks varied per day, but they mainly consisted of pruning and chipping tree branches, planting, fertilizing, and watering new trees, as well as disposing of logs with a front-end-loader that are too large to be chipped.\r There were essentially two groups of co-workers: the permanents and the casuals. Many of the permanents were patient in training the younger casuals and quite approachable when needing any help. \r The most difficult part would be the occasional heavy-lifting, which would normally not be an issue, however it can be exhausting in the summer when working outside. The most enjoyable part would be when your efforts are acknowledge by thankful citizens, who appreciate you removing a dead tree in front of their house or planting a new one.", "pros": "Paid well, co-workers were friendly", "cons": "Working outside in the summer without air-conditioned vehicles", "date_created": "December 5, 2014"},
