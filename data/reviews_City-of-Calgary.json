A typical day for me would include, arriving at one of the many mobile skate parks we had assembled around various communities in the city, and unlocking and positioning obstacles for the days activities. From there, me and another co-worker would teach a couple of the lessons scheduled for the day, each with a group of 10-18 kids per instructor. We would assess the children s skill levels, and base instruction accordingly. From there we would allow the children to have spare time where they could practice their newly learned skills, and converse and engage with them, until the parks closing time.\nI learned much from this job in regards to responsibility, care taking, and customer service. Speaking with the many children and parents I engaged with on a day to day basis helped me learn much about people, and was character developing for myself. It truly is amazing how much you can learn from people, especially children.\nThe people I worked with were excellent individuals, with as much passion and drive as i had for this sport, which was refreshing.
