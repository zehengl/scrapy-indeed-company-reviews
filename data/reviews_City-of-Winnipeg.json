I have worked a variety of jobs starting from factory work all the way to construction project management. It is unfortunate that a place like the City of Winnipeg, that used to be known as a great place to work, has become a thankless workplace filled with bullies, liars, and spineless management. The lack of support and succession planning within this department is mind boggling and is the main reason as to why I left. Current management does not want to see staff grow and succeed and they trap you and once your wage it maxed there is no growth. Because this is a union environment you either have to wait for someone above you to quit or die in order to move up and even then candidates are not selected based off of their skills and capabilities, but by the number of years that they have put into the city (which can be a LOT and a long wait to be able to advance if you\u2019re even given the chance. Current management would rather see external staff in management jobs instead of providing current staff the opportunity and support to grow and advance. They also try to cover up hiring mistakes by bullying people out of positions so that they can accommodate unqualified staff. If you are not awarded a position, you will never get a straight answer OR be told things like \u201cthe only reason you received an interview was because it was a courtesy interview, you would never have been selected for that job.\u201d Working in the Planning, Property,\n and Development department is a soul sucking and crushing experience. In some cases, job promotions are given for a CUPE staff to a WAPSO staff based off of a popularity contest.
