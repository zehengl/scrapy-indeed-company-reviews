{"id": "0ca368b400dd3574", "rating": 1.0, "text": "Worked for organization for over 10+ years. Culture became progressively more and more toxic. Outdated x-style management including constantly reminding employees of their pay rate while justifying disrespectful treatment; lack of communication directly from the top (example: decrease in number of directors without informing employees); CONSTANT reorganization; job descriptions written/re-written for specific person wanted within a role (vs. searching for best candidate); maintaining budget by purposely leaving jobs unfilled for 6 months to 2 years and belittling the many employees who brought up practices internally while turning around and claiming it was unknown years later to media; saviour-like attitude towards jobs being filled by \"someone amazing from out-of-territory\" vs. understanding that investing in employee growth is invaluable; general bullying and ostrasizing of employees who are not liked personally by management; managers across multiple Divisions who are encouraged to bring up employees challenges (vs. working with their strengths); nepotistic hiring practices (relations/friends of Mayor, Counsellors, City Manager and Directors often land in cushy jobs with no prior education or experience); played-out personal revenge tactics by City Counsellors in newspapers including scape-goating of last City Manager; inability of Counsellors and Senior Management to design, deliver and execute plans in a timely manner; committees made-up of \"old boys clubs\" with sexist overtones. Many Counsellors are looking to pad their resumes to apply to Territorial politics and are\n not overly invested in the City. The organization is easily 15 years behind other cities in terms of policies and progression; action on projects is often justified by looking at what other Cities are doing and trying to mimic them without getting a handle on internal challenges. Unfortunately it's a work environment where innovation is often discouraged and where credit is taken for great work.  \nThe organization is full of great people, and in theory should be wonderful place to work, however it needs a total house-clean at the top. A lot of those at the top are just people who stuck around the organization for long enough, and are resistant to and even resentful of those coming in with new ideas and external leadership experience. Hopefully a culture shift occurs, however the Mayor was just re-elected for the third time.", "pros": "Good benefits and pay; may form great relationships while in survival-mode", "cons": "Everything else", "date_created": "11 January 2019"},
